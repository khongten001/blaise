# Internal-toolchain conformance check for the Blaise self-hosting toolchain.
#
# WHAT IT GUARDS:
#   The DEFAULT native pipeline since v0.12.0 is the in-process internal
#   assembler (blaise.assembler.x86_64) + internal linker (blaise.linker.elf):
#   source -> native .s -> internal assembler -> .o -> internal linker ->
#   executable, with zero external tools (only distro CRT objects are read).
#   This script asserts that the fully-internal pipeline produces a binary
#   that BEHAVES identically to the trusted all-external (gcc assemble + gcc
#   link) reference.
#
# WHY IT EXISTS, separately from fixpoint-native.sh:
#   fixpoint-native.sh validates native CODEGEN by diffing the emitted .s
#   text, but it assembles + links that text with EXTERNAL gcc.  Neither the
#   internal assembler nor the internal linker is on that path, so a defect
#   in either silently passes both fixpoints (this is exactly how the
#   sret-Result field-read bug hid; see bugs.txt 2026-06-16).  This script is
#   the only fixpoint-level guard that drives both internal tools end to end.
#
# WHY IT IS A DIFFERENTIAL CHECK, NOT A SELF-HOSTING FIXPOINT:
#   The internal assembler currently buffers the whole assembly + ELF
#   object in memory, so assembling the compiler's own ~631k-line .s needs
#   ~53 GB and OOM-kills.  A true "compile the compiler with itself via the
#   internal toolchain" fixpoint is therefore not feasible until the internal
#   assembler streams its output.  Instead we compile a representative program
#   that exercises the bug-prone paths (record-return sret-Result field reads,
#   immutable string literals) BOTH ways and assert the internal-toolchain
#   binary BEHAVES identically (stdout + exit code) to the all-external
#   reference.  Note: the internal and external tools may emit
#   different-but-valid encodings / section layouts, so a byte-level compare
#   would false-positive; behavioural equivalence is the sound invariant.
#
# Requires: a native compiler at compiler/target/blaise (run the QBE
# fixpoint or `pasbuild compile` first).  The RTL is source-built by the
# driver, so no blaise_rtl.a is needed.
