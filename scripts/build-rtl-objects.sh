#!/bin/bash
# Build the implicit RTL object files from source, mirroring the compiler's
# own TBackendDriver.EnsureRTLObjects.  Used by the fixpoint / bootstrap
# scripts to link a self-hosted compiler binary WITHOUT the legacy
# blaise_rtl.a archive (RTL-unification Stage 3).
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/build-rtl-objects.sh <blaise-binary> <out-dir> [options]
# Options:
#   --with-startup            include runtime.start (its bare _start)
#   --exclude-defined-by FILE omit any RTL object that defines a symbol FILE
#                             already defines (FILE is the main program object)
#
# Builds each RTL unit into <out-dir>/<unit>.o and prints, one per line on
# stdout, the object paths to put on the link line.  By default runtime.start
# (the bare _start entry) is OMITTED — a gcc/cc link line gets _start from libc
# and calls main.  Pass --with-startup to include it (a -nostartfiles / native
# internal link that owns the entry point).
#
# --exclude-defined-by handles the self-host link: a whole-program --emit-ir
# dump INLINES the RTL units the compiler transitively uses (runtime.arc via
# `uses classes`, etc.), so the program object already defines their symbols.
# Linking our standalone copy too would double-define them; this option drops
# the redundant objects, mirroring the compiler driver's own dedup.
#
# The build goes through a --unit-cache so each unit references its RTL deps'
# globals externally instead of re-defining them (the archive's member
# selection used to hide those duplicate definitions; explicit .o files do not).
# RTL units carry inline asm, so the native backend + internal assembler is
# mandatory.  Build order is leaf-first so each unit's deps are already cached.
