# Incremental warm-cache rebuild guard for the Blaise self-hosting toolchain.
#
# WHAT IT GUARDS:
#   The incremental --unit-cache path: when the compiler rebuilds a program
#   whose dependency units are loaded from a POPULATED cache (their cached
#   .bif interface + .o object) instead of from source.  This script compiles
#   the WHOLE COMPILER twice into the SAME --unit-cache: the first build fills
#   the cache from source, the second build recompiles the top program against
#   the cached interfaces.  It asserts the warm-cache rebuild produces a binary
#   that is present, plausibly sized, AND behaviourally CORRECT (compiles +
#   runs a hello-world program), not merely a non-empty file.
#
# WHY IT EXISTS, separately from the other fixpoint scripts:
#   A whole class of bugs only manifests when a unit is loaded from its cached
#   .bif/.o rather than recompiled from source — a dropped field, a wrong
#   vtable slot, a duplicate global, a missing initialiser in the cached
#   interface round-trip.  None of the existing fixpoints exercise that path:
#   fixpoint.sh uses --emit-ir (no cache at all), fixpoint-native.sh diffs the
#   emitted .s (no cache), and fixpoint-native-internal.sh compiles a tiny
#   probe program (no large warm cache).  So a regression in the cached-
#   interface import / round-trip passes every current fixpoint and only blows
#   up later when an end user does an incremental rebuild.  This script is the
#   only fixpoint-level guard that drives a real warm --unit-cache rebuild of
#   a large codebase end to end.
#
# WHY THE BEHAVIOURAL CHECK MATTERS:
#   A broken warm-cache rebuild was observed to produce a truncated binary
#   (~1.9 MB vs the ~2.8 MB clean build) that SIGABRTs or prints nothing.  So
#   beyond "exit 0 + plausible size" we compile + run a hello-world program
#   with BOTH the clean-cache and warm-cache stage-2 binaries and require each
#   to print "Hello" and exit 0.  Present-but-wrong is the failure mode this
#   guard is built to catch.
#
# Requires: a current native-built compiler at compiler/target/blaise (run
# `pasbuild compile -m blaise-compiler` first).  The RTL is source-built by
# the driver, so no blaise_rtl.a is needed.
