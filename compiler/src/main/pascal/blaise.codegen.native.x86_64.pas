{ x86_64 (System V AMD64 ABI) backend for the native code generator.

  Emits AT&T-syntax assembly text (fed to `as`/`cc`, like QBE's .s output).

  Expression evaluation strategy (naive, correctness-first): every integer
  expression is evaluated into %eax.  Binary operators evaluate the left
  operand into %eax, push it, evaluate the right operand into %eax, pop the
  left into %ecx, then combine.  This needs no register allocator and is
  correct for arbitrary nesting; the push/pop pairs are always balanced within
  one expression, so %rsp is back to its frame-aligned position at every call
  site (SysV requires 16-byte alignment at calls).

  Milestone M2: integer literals, + - * div mod, and Write/WriteLn of integers
  (mapped to the _SysWriteInt / _SysWriteNewline runtime calls). }

        the chain (e.g. MakeIt().A.B.Method(): freeing the MakeIt() transient

{ Consume ASlots argument slots already pushed onto the stack (slot 0 pushed
  first, so slot 0 is at the highest address and slot ASlots-1 is on top) into
  the System V integer argument registers starting at register index ABase
  (ABase = 1 when only %rdi is pre-reserved for the sret buffer, ABase = 2 when
  %rdi=sret buffer and %rsi=receiver/Self are both pre-reserved).

  The first (6 - ABase) slots map to the remaining integer registers; any
  further slots overflow onto the stack per the System V ABI.

  Stack geometry (offsets from %rsp on entry, all in bytes):
    slot i lives at (ASlots-1-i)*8.  So the RegSlots register-mapped slots
    (i = 0..RegSlots-1) occupy the HIGH offsets and the overflow slots
    (i = RegSlots..ASlots-1) occupy the LOW offsets — but in reverse order
    (slot ASlots-1 at offset 0).  System V wants the lowest-indexed overflow
    slot at the lowest address at call time.

  Strategy: load the register slots with `movq` (not pop).  Then relocate the
  overflow slots into the HIGH part of the region (just below the sret buffer)
  in ascending index order, and raise %rsp past the vacated register-slot
  space so the overflow ends up at 0(%rsp).., slot RegSlots first.  The
  relocation runs highest-target-first so a target never overwrites an
  as-yet-unmoved source.

  Returns the number of stack bytes occupied by overflow arguments at call time;
  the caller must `addq` this back after the call (before any sret-buffer slide).
  For ASlots <= (6 - ABase) the result is 0 and the stack is fully consumed. }

    1. leaq ASretAddr → %r10  (save addr before arg eval clobbers %rax/%rdi)
    2. Evaluate each normal arg (push/pop strategy for integer args)

{ Emit the program entry function.

  The Blaise runtime expects an exported `main(argc, argv)` returning int.  It
  must call $_SetArgs(argc, argv) before any program code, then run the body,
  then return 0.  This mirrors the QBE backend's $main shape (see the QBE IR
  for an empty program).

  The body statements are lowered between the _SetArgs call and the return-0
  epilogue.  After `pushq %rbp` the stack is 16-byte aligned, and expression
  evaluation balances its push/pop pairs, so %rsp stays aligned at every call
  site. }
