{ x86_64 (System V AMD64 ABI) backend for the native code generator.

  Emits AT&T-syntax assembly text (fed to `as`/`cc`, like QBE's .s output).

  Expression evaluation strategy (naive, correctness-first): every integer
  expression is evaluated into %eax.  Binary operators evaluate the left
  operand into %eax, push it, evaluate the right operand into %eax, pop the
  left into %ecx, then combine.  This needs no register allocator and is
  correct for arbitrary nesting; the push/pop pairs are always balanced within
  one expression, so %rsp is back to its frame-aligned position at every call
  site (SysV requires 16-byte alignment at calls).

  Milestone M2: integer literals, + - * div mod, and Write/WriteLn of integers
  (mapped to the _SysWriteInt / _SysWriteNewline runtime calls). }

            record elements) — the same shared helper the arm64 backend's
            main epilogue uses, so both architectures release program-level
            aggregates through one code path.

            Before this, the kind chain covered string/class/dyn-array/
            interface/record only: a PROGRAM-level `array[0..N] of TFoo`
            is registered as a GLOBAL (EmitProgram accepts tyStaticArray),
            so it fell off the end of the chain and every element leaked.
            The identical array inside a procedure was fine — that goes
            through the separate procedure-frame walk, which grew its
            tyStaticArray arm in the BUG-016 stage-2 work.  QBE never had
            the gap: it has one cleanup routine for both cases.

            The arkAggregate classification already excludes an unmanaged
            aggregate, so nothing is emitted for one (the record arm used
            to emit a bare pushq/leaq/popq trio for a record with no
            managed fields).

            Safe against manual element lifetimes: A[I].Free() nils the
            element slot, so this walk is a no-op on already-freed

  take the frame's own strong reference, then snapshot captured VALUE
  parameters from their spilled slots into the env fields (managed values
  take an extra retain — the env owns its copy independently of the param
  slot, which the param-exit pass releases separately).  Thunk: the env
  arrives through the hidden '__env' first parameter and is BORROWED.
  Either way, each promoted name's '_cap_<Name>' slot receives the field's
  heap address so every IsCaptured access path redirects unchanged. }

{ Consume ASlots argument slots already pushed onto the stack (slot 0 pushed
  first, so slot 0 is at the highest address and slot ASlots-1 is on top) into
  the System V integer argument registers starting at register index ABase
  (ABase = 1 when only %rdi is pre-reserved for the sret buffer, ABase = 2 when
  %rdi=sret buffer and %rsi=receiver/Self are both pre-reserved).

  The first (6 - ABase) slots map to the remaining integer registers; any
  further slots overflow onto the stack per the System V ABI.

  Stack geometry (offsets from %rsp on entry, all in bytes):
    slot i lives at (ASlots-1-i)*8.  So the RegSlots register-mapped slots
    (i = 0..RegSlots-1) occupy the HIGH offsets and the overflow slots
    (i = RegSlots..ASlots-1) occupy the LOW offsets — but in reverse order
    (slot ASlots-1 at offset 0).  System V wants the lowest-indexed overflow
    slot at the lowest address at call time.

  Strategy: load the register slots with `movq` (not pop).  Then relocate the
  overflow slots into the HIGH part of the region (just below the sret buffer)
  in ascending index order, and raise %rsp past the vacated register-slot
  space so the overflow ends up at 0(%rsp).., slot RegSlots first.  The
  relocation runs highest-target-first so a target never overwrites an
  as-yet-unmoved source.

  Returns the number of stack bytes occupied by overflow arguments at call time;
  the caller must `addq` this back after the call (before any sret-buffer slide).
  For ASlots <= (6 - ABase) the result is 0 and the stack is fully consumed. }

      is reclaimed after the call via the hoist epilogue's base bytes.

  The Blaise runtime expects an exported `main(argc, argv)` returning int.  It

  then return 0.  This mirrors the QBE backend's $main shape (see the QBE IR
  for an empty program).

  epilogue.  After `pushq %rbp` the stack is 16-byte aligned, and expression
