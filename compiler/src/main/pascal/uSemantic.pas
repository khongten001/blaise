unit uSemantic;

// Semantic analysis pass — walks the AST produced by uParser and:
//   1. Resolves record/class type declarations and registers them in the symbol table.
//   2. Indexes class methods for dispatch lookup.
//   3. Analyses method bodies with Self and explicit params in scope.
//   4. Resolves every identifier to a TSymbol in the symbol table.
//   5. Infers and annotates every expression node with ResolvedType.
//   6. Type-checks assignments, field assignments, and method calls.
//   7. Validates procedure/function calls.
//   8. Raises ESemanticError with source position on any violation.

implementation

{ Float<->string conversion uses the RTL's pure-Pascal _DoubleToStr / _StrToDouble,
  NOT libc's snprintf / strtod.  snprintf is a genuinely variadic function;
  declaring it with a fixed Double parameter violates the SysV x86-64 variadic ABI
  (the %al vector-register count is left unset), so glibc may read the double from
  the wrong place and emit a wrong string (environment-dependent miscompilation of
  folded float constants — passes locally, fails in CI).  Routing both directions
  through the RTL also drops the last libc dependency in this path, so a --static
  (libc-free) build of the compiler links without strtod. }

    the AST TypeDecls but ClassUnitPrefix's symbol Lookup must still find the

    The unit's own bodies still resolve them via layer 3 (owner = current
    unit); code generation resolves them by setting the emitted unit as the
    table's viewing context.

    (layer-1 visible to the unit's own bodies, never global, so they never need

      2. Implicit Self.member (incl. inherited via class chain) —
         shadows a unit-level proc of the same name.  Was the bug:
         a `uses strutils` in scope used to bind unqualified
         CountOccurrences inside a class method to strutils's
         version, even when the enclosing class declared its own.

  { Math builtins — Sqrt, Ceil, Floor, Round, Trunc, Ln, Log2, Log10,
    Power, Sin, Cos, Tan, ArcTan, ArcTan2, IsNaN, IsInfinite.
    These are implemented as compiler builtins rather than RTL functions
    so that the codegen can emit dtosi/stosi for the float→integer
    conversions (Ceil/Floor/Round/Trunc) and can dispatch to the *f
    variants for Single arguments on the trig functions.
    Integer-family arguments are accepted and implicitly widened to
    Double (FloatBuiltinArgType) — matching FPC/Delphi and Blaise's own
    implicit int→float assignment rule.
    Min and Max are implemented in pure Pascal in math.pas because they
    are handled correctly by normal overload resolution. }

     CheckTypesMatch then accepts the literal against any identically-shaped
     named 'reference to' type via IsCompatibleWith — no target-typing needed
     because the literal is fully typed by the grammar.

  2. The lifted thunk: a hidden module-level routine '__closure_<n>' with the
     uniform closure ABI — the environment pointer arrives as a hidden
     '__env: Pointer' FIRST parameter (unused by capture-free bodies; the
     call site always passes the fat value's Env half).  The thunk shares
     the literal's Body (OwnBody = False) and is queued on
     FPendingAnonDecls; DrainPendingAnonDecls registers and analyses it in
     MODULE scope after the enclosing bodies complete, so a body that
