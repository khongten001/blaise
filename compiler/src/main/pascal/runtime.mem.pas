  blaise_mem — Pascal memory allocator for the Blaise runtime.

  Replaces libc malloc/free/realloc with an allocator backed by POSIX
  mmap/munmap.  Self-contained: no dependency on strings, ARC, or
  any stdlib unit.

  Design:

  Small allocations (up to LARGE_THRESHOLD bytes):
    Served from 64 KB arenas obtained via mmap.  Each allocation has
    a 16-byte header storing the usable size and a back-pointer to the
    owning arena (the routing key for the migration-safe cross-thread
    free path — docs/concurrent-allocator-design.adoc).  Freed blocks
    go onto a per-size-class freelist for O(1) reuse.  Size classes are
    powers of two: 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048.

    Only the head arena is used for bump allocation.  When it fills,
    a new arena is allocated and becomes the head.  No arena-list walk.

  Large allocations (above LARGE_THRESHOLD):
    Each gets its own mmap region with a 24-byte header.  Freed large
    blocks are cached on a LIFO freelist for O(1) reuse.  The cache
    holds up to LARGE_CACHE_MAX entries; excess blocks are munmap-ed
    immediately.  Large reallocs use Linux mremap to resize in-place
    without copying.  All mmap sizes are rounded up to page granularity
    (4 KB) for better cache hit rates.

  All returned pointers are 8-byte aligned.

  Thread safety:
    All allocator state (arenas, freelists, large-block cache) is
    declared as threadvar, giving each thread its own independent
    allocator instance with zero contention and no locks on the local
    paths.  Spawned threads start with nil arenas and empty freelists;
    their first allocation creates a fresh arena via mmap.  Memory
    allocated on one thread MAY be freed on another: a foreign free is
    routed back to the owning arena through its MPSC remote-free queue
    and drained by the owner (concurrent-allocator-design.adoc).

  Teardown (phase 5, §Teardown of the design):
    Every arena is registered on a process-global registry (CAS
    spinlock).  A thread-exit hook (pthread TSD destructor for workers,
    __cxa_atexit for the main thread) unmaps the exiting thread's fully
    free arenas and marks the rest abandoned (OwnerTid = 0); abandoned
    arenas are later adopted or unmapped by the reclamation sweep, run
    from the allocation cold path and _MemReclaimAbandoned.  A per-arena
    live-block counter with decrement-at-drain semantics decides "fully
    free".

{ CROSS-LAYOUT INVARIANT (concurrent-allocator-design.adoc, §Data
  structures): IsLarge and GetAllocSize classify a block by reading Flags
  through the SMALL layout at Ptr - HEADER_SIZE, regardless of the block
  kind.  This works only because both layouts place Flags at the same
  distance from the user pointer:

    small: Ptr - 16 + 4  = Ptr - 12
    large: Ptr - 24 + 12 = Ptr - 12

  New fields must therefore be appended AFTER Flags in both records;
  reordering either silently breaks every free.  The invariant is pinned
  by Test_FlagsOffset_Invariant in test_blaise_mem.pas. }

      OwnerTid identifies the owning thread (0 = abandoned).  It is
      written at creation (before the arena is published), and afterwards
      only under the registry spinlock — abandonment stores 0 via
      _AtomicXchgPtr, adoption CASes 0 -> adopter tid — while the free
      path reads it without the lock (the owner-vs-foreign test).

      RemoteList links the arena onto the process-global arena registry
      (phase 5), mutated only under the registry spinlock.

      +1 per allocation from the arena, -1 per LOCAL free, -1 per block
      at DRAIN time (never at remote-push time — decrement-at-drain).
      All mutations go through _AtomicAddInt64; only the current owner
      mutates it, and ownership handoff is serialised by the registry
      lock, so a zero observed by the owner is stable: a remote push
      requires the pusher to hold a live (counted) block. }
