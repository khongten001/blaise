{ End-to-end separate-compilation gate.

  Drives the headline feature through the actual blaise binary rather
  than the in-process pipeline used by the other E2E suites:

    1. blaise --source Dep.pas --output Dep.o
         -> ELF .o with .blaise.iface embedded
    2. Dep.pas removed from disk
    3. blaise --source UseDep.pas --output use_dep --unit-path <dir-with-Dep.o>
         -> compiler picks up Dep.o via auto-discovery, reads the iface
            out of the embedded section, links the program
    4. ./use_dep
         -> prints the expected output

  Covers both free routines (where only the call site needs the iface)
  and generic classes (where the consumer instantiates the template
  using bodies carried in the .blaise.iface — no source TUnit
  required). }

      unit-level global of such a unit has a bare data symbol.  Under
      --no-incremental every object that references the class / inlines the unit
      re-DEFINES those bare symbols; two such objects archived together then
      collide at link with a multiple-definition error.  The fix emits the
      definitions WEAK so the copies collapse.  This test compiles two rtl.*
      leaf units (each using a shared rtl.* base unit) standalone with
      --no-incremental, archives all three, and links a driver that pulls BOTH
      leaves — the link must succeed and the program run. }

      loops only walked IntfBlock.TypeDecls.  The fix registers impl-section

      Per-unit codegen left DefineOwningUnit pointing at a dependency unit by the
      time the init block was emitted, so the impl-section class symbol was
      suppressed by Lookup's cross-unit-leak guard and the metaclass ref mangled

    { Regression: compiling a UNIT (unit-mode, top source is a `unit`) that
      USES another unit, with the default incremental path, segfaulted — the
      incremental worker setup read Prog.SymbolTable, but in unit-mode Prog is
      nil (the table comes from the semantic pass).  This is the exact path the
      runtime Makefile drives (every RTL unit is compiled `--source X.pas
      --output X.o`), so it broke `make` in runtime/. }

      inside a method) compiled in unit-mode (.o) emitted `movsd FFloat(%rip)`
      — a load from a global symbol named after the field instead of from
      Self+offset — producing an undefined `FFloat` symbol.  The store path was
      already correct; only the read was broken, and only in per-unit codegen
      (whole-program builds resolved it as a field offset). }
    procedure TestNativeIncremental_FloatFieldRead_InUnit;
    { Regression: a unit that USES another unit only in its IMPLEMENTATION
      section.  On a clean build all units are parsed, so the impl-only
      dependency's object is linked.  But on an incremental REBUILD, the
      consuming unit is loaded from its cached .o/.bif — and the .bif only
      recorded the INTERFACE uses, so the impl-only dependency was never
      loaded and its .o was dropped from the link → undefined symbol at
      run time.  This is exactly what broke a second `pasbuild test-compile`
      (the compiler rebuilt itself incrementally into a populated cache and
      lost ~880 KB of impl-only-dependency code). }
    procedure TestIncrementalRebuild_ImplOnlyUses_LinksDependency;
    { Regression: a non-virtual constructor named 'Create' receives an
      implicit vtable slot (metaclass dispatch through a class-of
      reference).  The source-side semantic pass added that slot, but the
      cached-.bif importer (uSemanticImport.RegisterClassMethod) only added
      slots for virtual/override methods — so a descendant class compiled
      against a CACHED base unit built a vtable that omitted the Create slot
      and shifted every later virtual method up.  A Cls.Create call then
      dispatched through the wrong vtable slot (it hit the method that fell
      into Create's old index), so the constructor body never ran and the
      object's fields stayed nil.  This crashed the stdlib JSON test suite
      when its TTestCase base came from target/units. }
    procedure TestIncrementalRebuild_VirtualCtorVtableSlot;
    { Regression (bugs.txt warm --unit-cache): a leaf class inherits a method
      from a GRANDPARENT class that lives in a different cached unit.  On a
      warm rebuild the leaf unit recompiles from source while its ancestors
      load from cached .bif ifaces.  A cross-unit parent is serialised in the
      .bif with its unit qualifier (e.g. `base.TBase`); the importer resolved
      the parent with a bare Lookup that missed the qualified name, leaving the
      intermediate class's Parent pointer nil — so the leaf's inherited-method
      walk dead-ended and reported "Undeclared procedure". }
    procedure TestIncrementalRebuild_QualifiedGrandparentMethod;
    { Regression (warm --unit-cache set-of-enum literal): the cached-.bif
      importer registered an enum's members as symbols but never populated the
      analyser's enum-member reverse index (FEnumMemberIndex).  ArgMatchScore
      is the one argument-matching path with no target type in hand: it must
      INFER a bracket literal's base enum from its elements, via
      SetLiteralBaseEnum -> ResolveEnumMember, which reads ONLY that index.
      Warm, the index was empty, so [oA] scored 0 against a `set of TOpt`
      parameter and the call was rejected with "No matching overload".  Cold
      builds passed because the source-visible path does register members. }
    procedure TestIncrementalRebuild_SetLiteralArg_EnumBase;
    procedure TestIncrementalRebuild_SetLiteralArg_OverloadedEnumBase;
    { The other two ArgMatchScore set arms — empty literal and a Byte-based
      set — never consulted the reverse index and passed warm even before the
      fix.  Locked in here so the index fix cannot regress them. }
    procedure TestIncrementalRebuild_SetLiteralArg_EmptyAndByteBase;
    { Two enums in a cached unit sharing a member name.  The source-visible
      path deliberately does NOT define enum members as bare global skConstant
      symbols (so names may be shared and resolved by context); the importer
      used to, which made a warm build hard-error where a cold build compiled. }
    procedure TestIncrementalRebuild_SharedEnumMemberName_Warm;
    { The same asymmetry seen through a BARE member reference rather than a
      set literal.  The importer's global skConstant for a shared name shadowed
      the reverse-index lookup (TryResolveBareEnumIdent bails to a real symbol
      of that name), so a warm build bound `S := cShared` to the FIRST enum's
      member and silently assigned the wrong ordinal — 1 instead of 3.  Wrong
      code, not a diagnostic, which is why this needs an execution check. }

      members — a static var, a static method, and a static const — declared in
      one unit and used through the COMPILED .bif boundary from another unit.
      The wire format already encoded the static facts, but the export clone
      dropped TFieldDecl.IsClassVar/ClassVarEmitName, TMethodDecl.IsStatic and
      TPropertyDecl.IsStatic before encoding; the importer ignored them and the
      decoded ConstDecls; and TRoutineSig carried no IsStatic field at all.  So
      a cross-unit TReg.Next() failed with "is not a static method", a static
      var did not register as a shared global, and TReg.Tag did not resolve.
      Driving through --unit-cache exercises the real .bif write+read path on
      both backends. }

      entirely from the cached interface (records never exported/imported
      their method sigs), an imported record method lost the record-receiver
      convention (IsRecordMethod), and a 'reference to' procedural type lost
      its closure flag on import (anon-method args then failed overload
      scoring).  One warm-cache round trip covers all three, per backend. }

    procedure TestRecordMethodsAndClosures_WarmCache_QBE;
    { Regression: two units EACH declaring a same-named unit-level `var` (and a
      same-named `threadvar`) must emit DISTINCT global symbols on the native
      backend (ua_GVal / ub_GVal), not one colliding bare `GVal`.  The native
      backend previously emitted and referenced module globals under their BARE
      name, so the internal linker silently merged the two units' slots (a shared-
      storage hazard) and the EXTERNAL linker rejected the build with "multiple
      definition of GVal".  The fix makes native honour the owning unit for module
      globals, mirroring the QBE backend.  Built with `--linker external` so a
      regression re-surfaces as a hard link failure, and the printed values prove
      the two slots are genuinely independent. }
    procedure TestSameNamedModuleVar_AcrossUnits_ExternalLink_Native;
    procedure TestSameNamedModuleVar_AcrossUnits_QBE;
    { Regression (BUGS.md BUG-004): generic-instance symbols were mangled from
      FOUR inconsistent sources — the instantiating unit's prefix (source
      instantiation), bare (instantiated during .bif import), Sym.OwningUnit
      (name-based codegen refs, poisoned to the re-exporting unit by import),
      and forced-bare (desc-based refs).  A consumer unit compiled in a multi-
      unit --unit-cache process could reference a copy under a prefix nobody
      ever emitted (e.g. Xml_Types_TOrderedDictionary_string_string_SetItem in
      the stdlib TestRunner) — the link succeeded lazily and the loader failed
      at run time with an undefined symbol.  The fix mangles ALL generic-
      instance symbols BARE at every site and emits them as WEAK symbols in
      per-unit mode so any number of objects may carry the (identical) copy and
      the linker dedups.  The scenario: uprovider instantiates TReg<Integer> in
      cache1's process; ureexport carries it as an interface field; a second
      process (cache2) compiles two consumers where the first-compiled one
      inherits the pending instance and the second references it through the
      default-property setter (the name-based path that read the poisoned
      OwningUnit). }
    procedure TestGenericInstance_CrossUnitCache_DefaultPropSetter_Runs;
    { Phase 6 (anonymous methods x generics): a generic class whose method
      body contains a closure literal, exported through the .bif generic-body
      template and monomorphised by a consumer that has no access to the
      source.  Covers the TAnonMethodExpr round-trip inside EncodeBlock and
      the per-instantiation thunk/env regeneration at the import site. }
    procedure TestGenericBodyClosure_RoundTrip_WithoutSource;
    { Colliding generic declarations: generic-instance symbols are mangled
      BARE (no unit prefix) and emitted WEAK so the linker folds the copies
      that multiple units materialise of the SAME instance (the BUG-004
      COMDAT model).  The flip side: two DIFFERENT generics with the same
      base name declared in two different units produce byte-identical
      instance symbols (e.g. TBox_Integer) and the linker would silently
      keep one and drop the other.  The front end cannot represent that
      case either (the template registry is keyed by bare base name), so
      it must be REJECTED with a diagnostic naming both units — at source
      analysis and on the cached-.bif import path alike. }
