{ Joint hardening tests for the L1 multicore fiber runtime
  (docs/async-networking-design.adoc, [#scheduler] and rtl-prerequisites):

    * leak-guard proof — the lockless leak tracker is SUSPENDED while N>1
      workers run (a fiber observes it disabled mid-run) and RESTORED after.
    * 100k-fibre stress — 100 000 fibers across N workers each allocate,
      migrate between workers, and hand off through a channel; the test
      asserts every fiber completed and the allocator's arena registry
      returns to (near) its pre-run baseline, exercising exactly the
      cross-thread free + abandoned-arena reclamation the migration-safe
      allocator (P2 / phase 5) exists for.

  NATIVE BACKEND ONLY.  Self-registers via the initialization section. }

    up.  (Note: total arena COUNT does grow across repeated RunSchedulerMC
    calls because per-worker arenas are not reclaimed on thread EXIT — a
    separate allocator gap logged in bugs.txt; within a single run there is no
    growth problem, which is what this test covers.) }
