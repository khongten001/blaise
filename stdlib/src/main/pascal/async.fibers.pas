unit async.fibers;

// L1 of the fiber runtime (docs/async-networking-design.adoc, [#scheduler]):
// the single-worker scheduler and its intrinsic structures — the intrusive
// FIFO run queue and the 4-ary timer min-heap keyed by absolute monotonic
// deadline.
//
// The worker state (run queue, timer heap, current task, the scheduler's own
// L0 context) lives in a TWorker object so the multicore step (N workers,
// Chase-Lev work-stealing deques, a global injector queue) extends this
// module by adding workers rather than reworking it; at L1 there is exactly
// one worker, driven by RunScheduler on the calling thread.
//
// Per the design, the run queue link (NextReady) and the timer-heap slot
// (HeapIndex) are intrusive fields on the task itself — no per-operation
// allocation on the scheduling hot path.  The heap is 4-ary: shallower than
// a binary heap for the same size, and sift-down touches one cache line of
// children per level.
//
// NATIVE BACKEND ONLY: this unit uses async.fibers.context.x86_64, whose
// context-switch leaf is inline asm; the QBE backend rejects it with a clear
// diagnostic (the design's compile-time guard).
//
// Clock and idle-sleep bindings are Linux-shaped libc calls
// (clock_gettime/nanosleep), the same posture as the context unit's mmap
// bindings.

  Scheduling per worker follows the design: LIFO hand-off slot -> local
  Chase-Lev deque (PopBottom) -> steal from a random peer -> global injector
  queue.  Idle workers PARK on a futex (never busy-wait) and are woken when a
  task is handed to them or spawned into the injector.

  Fibers spawned with SpawnFiber from inside a worker land on that worker's
  local deque; spawns from outside any worker go to the global injector.

  The leak tracker is a lockless global table and is SUSPENDED for the whole
  run (N>1), then restored — running it under concurrent create/release would
  corrupt it (design <<rtl-prerequisites>>).  Existing single-worker

  its runtime.mem allocator arenas back at THREAD EXIT — makes the arena
  registry grow across repeated runs (thread-exit churn + lazy-reclaim lag).

  The pool separates POOL lifecycle from BATCH lifecycle: the peer threads are
  created ONCE (FiberPoolStart) and PARK between batches instead of exiting, so
  their arenas stay hot and are reused across every batch.  A batch is driven by
  FiberPoolRun (worker 0 runs on the calling thread, returns when the batch's
  fibers have all finished; the peers park for the next batch).  FiberPoolShutdown
  signals the peers to leave their loops, joins them, and tears the pool down.

  Fibers spawned between FiberPoolStart and a FiberPoolRun (and re-spawned for a
  SECOND FiberPoolRun on the same pool) route into the injector and run on the
  batch.  The leak tracker is suspended for the whole pool lifetime (across every
  batch), not toggled per batch. }

{ Create the pool once.  ANumWorkers <= 0 defaults to GetCPUCount.  Worker 0
  drives on the calling thread during each FiberPoolRun; workers 1..N-1 live on
  their own pthreads, parked until the first batch.  Raises if a pool or a
  per-call RunSchedulerMC is already active. }
procedure FiberPoolStart(ANumWorkers: Integer = 0);

  lock, so a concurrent FiberResume can find it.  Off-scheduler it is a
  no-op (returns immediately) — callers must handle the non-fiber path
  themselves (e.g. a blocking OS wait).  Observes cancellation on resume:
