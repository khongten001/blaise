unit async.reactor;

// L2 of the fiber runtime (docs/async-networking-design.adoc, [#reactor]): the
// readiness reactor.  A TReactor tracks per-fd interest (read/write) and blocks
// in Wait until one or more fds are ready or a Wake interrupts it, delivering
// the opaque tokens registered with each fd.  The scheduler (async.fibers) uses
// the token — a TFiberTask — to resume the fiber parked on that fd.
//
// TReactor is abstract; the per-OS adapters live in their own units
// (async.reactor.epoll for Linux, async.reactor.kqueue for FreeBSD — the
// design's "one async.reactor.<mech>.pas per OS").  Each adapter's
// initialization block registers its factory in GReactorFactory here; the
// scheduler (async.fibers) pulls in the right adapter unit for the RESOLVED
// --target via the project's ONE target-driven conditional (OS defines
// follow --target, not the build host, so cross-compilation selects the
// right adapter in both directions).  A TIocpReactor (Windows) slots in
// later as one more unit + one more branch at that seam.
