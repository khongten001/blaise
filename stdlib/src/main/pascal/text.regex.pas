{ Blaise stdlib - regular expressions.

  A .NET-shaped regular-expression API: an immutable TRegex object compiled
  once from a pattern, a TMatch value record carrying the result, and static
  convenience methods for one-off use.

  ENGINE — BACKTRACKING, AND WHY

  The matcher is a recursive backtracking engine over a compiled node tree,
  not a Thompson NFA simulation.  That is a deliberate trade.  A Thompson NFA
  gives guaranteed linear time in the subject length, but it cannot express
  backreferences, lookaround, atomic groups or possessive quantifiers, because
  those features need the match history that a set-of-states simulation throws
  away.  Backtracking keeps the history and therefore supports the full
  syntax below, at the cost of worst-case exponential time on adversarial
  pattern/subject pairs -- the classic '(a+)+b' blowup.

  One cheap pruning rule takes most of the sting out of that in practice: a
  quantifier only recurses into a further iteration when the previous
  iteration actually CONSUMED input.  A zero-width iteration cannot lead
  anywhere new, so continuing past it only re-explores the same partitions by
  another route.  Dropping those branches collapses the redundant
  re-partitioning that makes '(a+)+b', '(a*)*b' and '(a|a)+b' exponential in
  a naive backtracker -- they terminate here in linear-ish time -- while
  changing no match RESULT, because a zero-width iteration by definition adds
  nothing to what was matched.  The pruning is not a general guarantee, which
  is exactly why the step budget below is not optional.

  The matcher is written in continuation-passing style: MatchNode takes "what
  to do after this node succeeds" as a linked chain of TContinuation frames.
  A linked chain rather than a single (node-list, index) pair is essential --
  groups nest, so on entering a group body the matcher must remember both the
  rest of that body AND the rest of every enclosing sequence.  Passing the
  continuation down into each alternative and each quantifier iteration is
  what makes give-back work: when the tail of the pattern fails, control
  returns into the quantifier, which offers a shorter extent and re-runs the
  tail.

  STEP BUDGET

  Because exponential blowup is a real denial-of-service vector whenever a
  pattern or a subject comes from outside the program (an HTTP request handler
  is the motivating case), the matcher is not permitted to run unbounded.
  Every backtracking step increments a counter; when the counter passes
  StepLimit the match aborts with ERegexComplexity instead of hanging.

  The default limit is DEFAULT_STEP_LIMIT = 10,000,000 steps.  The number is
  chosen to be far above anything a well-behaved pattern needs -- ordinary
  matching costs on the order of (subject length x pattern size) steps, so a
  10 MB budget covers e.g. a 100 KB subject against a 100-node pattern with
  room to spare -- while still terminating a catastrophic pattern in well
  under a second.  Callers that knowingly run expensive patterns over large
  inputs can raise StepLimit; callers handling hostile input should lower it.
  The budget is a property of the TRegex, but the counter itself is a local
  in the match call, so raising the limit never makes matching stateful.

  A blown budget raises rather than returning "no match" on purpose: it is not
  a statement about the data (the subject may well match) but a statement that
  the answer could not be computed within the allowance, and silently
  reporting "no match" would turn a resource failure into a wrong answer.

  THREAD / FIBER SAFETY

  TRegex is IMMUTABLE once constructed: the compiled program is built in the
  constructor and never mutated afterwards, and NO match state whatsoever is
  stored on the object.  Capture registers, the step counter and the input
  cursor all live in locals of the matching call or in the caller's TMatch.
  A single TRegex can therefore be shared by any number of concurrent fibers
  or threads without locking.  This is an invariant worth preserving: adding
  a "last match" or scratch field to TRegex would silently break every
  concurrent user.  (StepLimit is settable and so is technically mutable, but
  it is read once at the start of a match; set it before sharing.)

  ERROR CONVENTION

  A malformed pattern is a programmer error -- the developer wrote it -- so it
  raises ERegexSyntaxError carrying a 0-based Position into the pattern.  A
  subject that simply does not match is data, not an error, so it is reported
  as Success = False with Index = -1.

  UNICODE POSITION (v1)

  Matching is BYTE-oriented and every Index/Length in a TMatch or TGroup is a
  BYTE offset into the subject, consistent with Length, Pos and Copy.  Mixing
  codepoint offsets into this API would be a trap: the offsets would not be
  usable with any other string routine in the stdlib.

  Consequences, stated plainly:

    * Multi-byte UTF-8 literals in a pattern work for free -- they match as
      byte runs, and a captured Value is byte-identical to the source text.
    * '.' is UTF-8 AWARE: it consumes one whole codepoint (1-4 bytes), so a
      match can never split a UTF-8 sequence and Value is always well-formed.
    * \d \w \s (and their negations) are ASCII-ONLY.  \w does not match an
      accented letter.
    * roIgnoreCase is ASCII-ONLY.  'E' folds to 'e'; U+00C9 does not fold to
      U+00E9.  Folding is applied when the pattern is compiled, so it costs
      nothing at match time.
    * A character-class RANGE whose endpoints are not both ASCII is rejected
      with ERegexSyntaxError, rather than silently matching an arbitrary
      byte range that almost certainly is not what the author meant.  A
      non-ASCII byte as a plain class member is still allowed.

  Full Unicode property classes and Unicode case folding are deliberately out
  of scope for v1.

  COMPILER WORKAROUNDS IN THIS UNIT

  Several constructs here are written less directly than they should be, to
  route around open compiler bugs.  Each site carries a comment naming the
  bug; they are collected here so they can be undone together once the bugs
  are fixed.

    * BUG-20260719-jumbo-set-field -- a jumbo set (>64 members) stored in a record or class FIELD
      silently loses every member, on BOTH backends.  So TRegexNode.Cls and
      TEscape.Cls hold an explicit 32-byte TClassBitmap instead of the
      'set of Byte' they want to be, and membership uses ClassHas rather than
      'in'.  The PARSER still accumulates classes as real sets, because jumbo
      sets are correct in locals; SetToClass/ClassToSet bridge the two.
    * BUG-20260719-jumbo-set-var-param -- a jumbo set as an out/var PARAMETER does not round-trip.
      ParseEscape returns a TEscape record instead of using out-parameters,
      and FoldClass is a function taking a const set rather than a var
      procedure.
    * BUG-20260719-jumbo-set-call-operand -- a jumbo-set operation with a function-CALL operand segfaults
      on the native backend.  Such calls are bound to a local first.
    * BUG-20260719-jumbo-set-self-assign -- 'X := F(X)' on a jumbo set miscompiles on the native
      backend.  Complement and fold results go to a distinct temporary.
    * BUG-20260719-jumbo-set-unit-init-link -- a jumbo-set operation in a unit INITIALIZATION section fails
      to link.  EmptyClass is a function, not an initialised global.
    * BUG-20260719-jumbo-set-cross-unit-import -- a NAMED set type over a non-enum base does not import under
      the QBE backend.  The byte-set type is written anonymously as
      'set of Byte' at each use rather than exported as a named type.
    * BUG-20260719-set-literal-vs-cached-bif -- a set LITERAL does not match a set parameter imported from a
      cached unit interface.  Callers in other units (including this unit's
      own tests) must bind options to a variable rather than passing
      '[roIgnoreCase]' directly.  See the note on the constructor.
    * BUG-20260719-native-indexed-prop-record -- an indexed property returning a record miscompiles on the
      native backend, so 'TList<TMatch>' must be read with L.Get(I) rather
      than L[I].  This affects CALLERS of Matches, not just this unit.
