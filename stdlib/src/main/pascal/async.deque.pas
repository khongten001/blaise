unit async.deque;

// L1 of the fiber runtime (docs/async-networking-design.adoc, [#scheduler]):
// a single-owner, multi-thief Chase-Lev work-stealing deque of task pointers.
//
// The owning worker does PushBottom / PopBottom lock-free at the BOTTOM end;
// any number of thieves do Steal at the TOP end via CAS.  This is the exact
// structure Go's scheduler, Tokio and the Java ForkJoinPool use for their
// per-worker run queues.
//
// The classic reference is Chase & Lev, "Dynamic Circular Work-Stealing
// Deque" (SPAA 2005), with the memory-ordering corrections from Le et al.,
// "Correct and Efficient Work-Stealing for Weak Memory Models" (PPoPP 2013).
//
//   * `top`    — the index thieves steal from (monotonically increasing).
//   * `bottom` — the index the owner pushes to / pops from.
//   * a circular buffer of capacity 2^k that GROWS (never shrinks here) when
//     the owner would overflow it.
//
// The subtle case is PopBottom when the deque has exactly one element: the
// owner and a thief both target that element, and the tie is broken by the
// SAME CAS on `top` that Steal uses, so exactly one of them wins.
//
// The tasks are UNTYPED pointers (Pointer), so this unit has no dependency on
// the scheduler's TFiberTask type — the scheduler stores TFiberTask instances
// as their raw pointer.  Ownership/ARC of the tasks is the scheduler's job;
// the deque only moves pointers.
//
// NATIVE BACKEND ONLY (transitively): it is only ever driven under N worker
// OS threads, and the whole fiber runtime is native-only.  The deque itself
// uses no inline asm — the atomics live in runtime.atomic.

  { A growable circular buffer of Pointer slots.  Capacity is always a power
    of two so index-into-slot is a mask, not a modulo.  Buffers are chained
    (OldBuf) rather than freed on growth, because a concurrent thief may still
    hold a reference to the previous buffer when the owner grows it; the whole
    chain is freed when the deque is destroyed. }
