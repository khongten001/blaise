 * Blaise RTL — Zeroing weak references.
 *
 * A weak reference is a slot (variable or field) pointing at a class
 * instance without contributing to its refcount.  When the backing
 * object's last strong reference is released and the object is about to
 * be freed, every registered weak slot pointing at it is nil'd — so a
 * subsequent dereference sees 0 rather than dangling memory.
 *
 * Design: one global open-chained hash table, keyed on the user_ptr of
 * the backing object.  Each entry carries a linked list of slot
 * addresses (pointers-to-pointers) that reference it.  Inserts and
 * removals are O(bucket-chain + slot-list) — acceptable because weak
 * references are rare relative to strong references.
 *
 * Single-threaded today: Blaise programs run on a single OS thread, so
 * no locking is needed.  When threading arrives, a global mutex around
 * the table (or a finer-grained strategy) will be required.
 *
 * API:
 *   _WeakAssign(slot, new_target) — register slot under new_target and
 *                                   store new_target at *slot; any prior
 *                                   registration for *slot is removed.
 *                                   new_target may be NULL (just unregister).
 *   _WeakClear(slot)              — unregister and zero *slot.  Called at
 *                                   scope exit and field cleanup for weak
 *                                   declarations.
 *   _WeakZeroSlots(target)        — nil every slot pointing at target and
 *                                   drop target's entry from the table.
 *                                   Called from _ClassRelease at refcount
 *                                   zero, before the field-cleanup fn
 *                                   runs and before the block is freed.
